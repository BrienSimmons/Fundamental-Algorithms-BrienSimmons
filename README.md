# Fundamental-Algorithms
 

 1. Provide Big O Notation for each of your solutions. -
    Insertion - Time complexity & Space complexity
    Reversed - Time complexity & Space complexity

 2. Research Quick, Bubble and Insertion sort. Describe which algorithm and how they perform. -
 
 Quick Sort: Efficient and widely used, especially for large datasets. Average-case time complexity is O(n log n), but it can degrade to O(n^2) in the worst case.
 
 Bubble Sort: Simple but inefficient, with a time complexity of O(n^2) in the average and worst cases. It's not typically used for practical applications.
 
 Insertion Sort: Simple and efficient for small or nearly sorted datasets. It has a best-case time complexity of O(n) but degrades to O(n^2) in the worst case.


 3. Research Dijkstra's Algorthim. Describe what problem this algorithm solves and list 2 situations, datasets, or real world applications that the algorithm can be used to solve. -
     1. GPS systems
     2. Computer network routing
